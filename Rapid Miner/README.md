## RapidMiner Processes

These workflows were completed as part of my **Data Warehousing and Data Mining** course to demonstrate data preparation and cleaning in RapidMiner. They show I'm comfortable with essential data processing tasks in no-code environments.

### Overview of Processes

- **data_dictionary.rmp**: Cleaned and standardized the data dictionary file by unifying column types, handling missing values, and reordering attributes for consistent schema design.

- **restaurants.rmp**: Prepared restaurant data by removing unnecessary fields (e.g., Zip_Code), standardizing column types, and aligning the schema with other datasets.

- **consumers.rmp**: Cleaned consumer data with multiple steps, including filling missing values, normalizing formats, and ensuring consistent attribute ordering for integration.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Data import and type standardization
- Missing value handling
- Attribute selection and reordering
